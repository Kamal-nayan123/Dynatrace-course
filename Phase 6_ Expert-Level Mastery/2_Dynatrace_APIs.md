# Phase 6: Expert-Level Mastery - Dynatrace APIs

## Introduction
While the Dynatrace web UI is powerful for visualization and manual configuration, true enterprise-scale management and automation are achieved through its comprehensive API ecosystem. Interacting with Dynatrace programmatically is the foundation of treating "Monitoring as Code" (or "Observability as Code"), where your monitoring configuration is version-controlled, automated, and repeatable, just like your application code.

## 1. Data Ingestion APIs

These APIs are designed to send telemetry data *into* the Dynatrace platform. They are the endpoints for enriching the data collected by OneAgent with your own custom metrics, logs, and events.

*   **Technical Definition:** A collection of REST endpoints designed to receive telemetry data from external sources. Dynatrace provides specific APIs for different data types, each with its own formatting requirements.
*   **Simple Definition:** These are the "mail slots" for Dynatrace. You use them to send new data to the platform that OneAgent doesn't collect automatically, such as business KPIs or data from a custom application.
*   **Key Ingestion APIs:**
    *   **Metrics API:** For sending custom time-series data (e.g., business metrics like `orders.processed`, technical metrics from a custom script).
    *   **Logs API:** For pushing log files or batches of log records into Dynatrace Log Management.
    *   **Events API:** For notifying Dynatrace about important single events, such as deployments, configuration changes, performance test results, or business events.
    *   **OpenTelemetry Ingest:** The primary endpoint for receiving standard OpenTelemetry (OTel) data, which Dynatrace then processes and correlates.

## 2. Configuration APIs

These APIs are for managing the configuration of the Dynatrace platform *itself*. They are the key to automating the setup and maintenance of your monitoring environment.

*   **Technical Definition:** A comprehensive set of REST APIs that expose the configuration of Dynatrace objects. They allow you to programmatically perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on almost any setting you could otherwise change in the UI.
*   **Simple Definition:** These APIs let you control the Dynatrace "settings" using code. Instead of clicking buttons in the UI to create a new alerting profile or a dashboard, you can write a script to do it. This is how you automate the management of Dynatrace.
*   **Common Configuration APIs and Their Uses:**
    *   **Management Zones API:** Automate the creation and maintenance of access control zones for different teams.
    *   **Alerting Profiles API:** Programmatically define alerting rules and integrations (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks).
    *   **Dashboards API:** Define dashboards as JSON documents, allowing you to store them in Git and deploy them automatically.
    *   **Settings API:** A powerful, schema-based API to manage thousands of Dynatrace settings, from anomaly detection rules to data privacy configurations.
    *   **Tags API:** Automatically apply tags to entities based on information from a CMDB or an external script.

## 3. Automation with Scripts

The true power of the API ecosystem is realized when you combine these APIs in scripts to automate complex workflows. This is a cornerstone of enterprise governance and "self-service" monitoring.

*   **Technical Definition:** This involves using a scripting language (like Python, PowerShell, or Go) to call multiple Dynatrace APIs in a sequence to perform a higher-level task. These scripts are often integrated into CI/CD pipelines or other automation platforms.
*   **Simple Definition:** This is where you put it all together. You can write a single script that completely sets up the monitoring for a new application team—creating their dashboards, alerts, and access rights—all in one go, in a repeatable and consistent way.

### Practical Example: New Service Onboarding Script
Imagine a new microservice, "project-phoenix," is being created. The goal is to automatically provision all the necessary Dynatrace components when the new service's code repository is created.

A Python script could be written to perform the following actions:

```python
# This is a conceptual Python script to illustrate the logic.
import requests
import json

# --- Configuration ---
DT_API_URL = "https://your-tenant.live.dynatrace.com/api"
DT_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Api-Token {DT_API_TOKEN}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

APP_NAME = "project-phoenix"
TEAM_TAG = f"team:{APP_NAME}"
SLACK_WEBHOOK = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."

# --- 1. Create a Management Zone using the Settings API ---
mz_payload = {
    "schemaId": "builtin:management-zones",
    "scope": "environment",
    "value": {
        "name": f"MZ for {APP_NAME}",
        "rules": [{"type": "ME", "enabled": True, "propagationTypes": [], "conditions": [{"key": {"attribute": "HOST_TAGS"}, "comparison": {"negate": False, "operator": "TAG_KEY_EQUALS", "value": TEAM_TAG}}]}]
    }
}
# response = requests.post(f"{DT_API_URL}/v2/settings/objects", headers=HEADERS, data=json.dumps([mz_payload]))
print(f"1. Created Management Zone for {APP_NAME}")


# --- 2. Create an Alerting Profile using the Configuration API ---
alert_payload = {
    "displayName": f"Alerts for {APP_NAME}",
    "rules": [
        {"severityLevel": "AVAILABILITY", "tagFilter": {"includeMode": "INCLUDE_ALL", "tagFilters": [{"context": "CONTEXTLESS", "key": TEAM_TAG}]}, "delayInMinutes": 0},
        {"severityLevel": "PERFORMANCE", "tagFilter": {"includeMode": "INCLUDE_ALL", "tagFilters": [{"context": "CONTEXTLESS", "key": TEAM_TAG}]}, "delayInMinutes": 5}
    ]
}
# response = requests.post(f"{DT_API_URL}/v1/alertingProfiles", headers=HEADERS, data=json.dumps(alert_payload))
alerting_profile_id = "example-id-123" # response.json()['id']
print(f"2. Created Alerting Profile for {APP_NAME}")

# --- 3. Add a Slack Notification to the Alerting Profile ---
notification_payload = {
    "type": "SLACK",
    "active": True,
    "name": f"Slack for {APP_NAME}",
    "alertingProfile": alerting_profile_id,
    "url": SLACK_WEBHOOK,
    "channel": f"#{APP_NAME}-alerts"
}
# response = requests.post(f"{DT_API_URL}/v1/notifications", headers=HEADERS, data=json.dumps(notification_payload))
print(f"3. Configured Slack notifications.")

print(f"\nOnboarding for '{APP_NAME}' complete. Now, simply tag your hosts with '{TEAM_TAG}'.")

```
This script, when run, automates a process that would take many manual clicks, ensuring every new service is onboarded with a consistent, best-practice monitoring configuration from day one.
